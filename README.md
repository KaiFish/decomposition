# A Lesson in Decomposition
This is a code base to teach students the fundementals of decomposition. Python's Turtle module is used to draw two pictures (from flower.py and house.py) that students can break down and recreate. They can do this from a final image of the output or a recording of the output process.

## functions.py
This file is composed of functions used in the other files. This is both to make the student's job easier and to introduce the idea of abstraction

## flower.py

The Flower is meant as an demo/class walkthrough example. Students can be given the `flower.py` code to follow along with the decomposition process. 

## house.py

The House is meant for student practice. They should **not** be given `house.py`. Students may attempt to recreate the `house.py` output on their own or they may use `skeleton.py` as a general guide. `skeleton.py` has all of the colors, size indications, and comments to guide students towards accurate completion.
